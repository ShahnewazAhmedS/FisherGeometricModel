# Abstract
The distribution of fitness effects (DFE) is a fundamental concept in evolutionary biology; understanding the DFE is important for analyzing a variety of phenomena, including quantitative traits, complex diseases, and the evolution of antibiotic resistance. The DFE is the set of fitness effects from all spontaneous mutations accessible to an organism's genome in a specific environment. However, since environments in nature are constantly changing, understanding how the DFE varies across different environments is crucial for predicting evolutionary outcomes. In this study, we employ the Fisher Geometric Model (FGM) to explore the statistical properties of DFEs and their dependence on environmental changes. The FGM provides a theoretical framework to model fitness landscapes, where mutations are represented as random perturbations in a high-dimensional phenotypic space, and fitness is determined by the distance to an optimal phenotype.

We compare the predictions of the FGM with empirical data from a large-scale study of $\sim 3800$ gene knockout mutants of \textit{E. coli} across $\sim 100$ environments. These environments include both stress conditions (e.g., antibiotics, metals, salts) and non-stress conditions (varying carbon and nitrogen sources). By simulating DFEs under various environmental conditions, we explore whether FGM can reproduce key statistical features observed in experimental data, such as the distributions of fitness means, variances, and correlation coefficients across different environments. Our results indicate that, while the FGM successfully captures certain aspects of the data, it falls short of fully explaining the observed patternsâ€”particularly the detailed shape of the distribution of correlation coefficients between environments. This study highlights the limitations of the FGM in describing empirical datasets and emphasizes the need for alternative or extended models to better capture the complexity of biological adaptation.
